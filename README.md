# SolarSAM
Comprehensive BIPV potential assessment methods for emerging city with SAM and satellite imagery 

## 1. Introduction

SolarSAM is a city-scale potential assessment model for building-integrated photovoltaic.

This model is based on Segment Anything Model and Satellite imagery data.

In this script, a demo for an emerging city is provided.

## 2. Data Preparation

The data are collected Google Earth. For more details, please refer to the following link: [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/)

and our paper.

## 3. Model Implementation

To run this model, you need to install the following packages:

samgeo

CV2

numpy

in python environment.

You can download this Repository with
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AI4RELab/SolarSAM.git
```
or just download with Github GUI

## 4. Files

### prompt engineering.py
